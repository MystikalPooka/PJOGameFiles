You mean this playerName = "[c][" + Ranks.GetRankColor(client.Player.Access).ToArgb() + "]" + client.Player.Name + "[/c]";

 for something that in well-written code is literally a 1-2 line change, this thing will require most likely 100-200 lines of changes or more across at least 6 files

Mystikal_Pooka: yes. that.


"[c]" is basically telling the parser that the following is a RGB color code so make the following code up to [/c] that rgb code

it then goes and gets the rank's color from the client.player class for the color, then goes to client.Player and gets the name associated with that player and outputs it

so essentially in pseudo code it would be something like "[pink]Mystikal_Pooka[/pink]" if the Pooka rank were returning the pink rgb code

that instead needs to be something like

playerName = "[" + client.Player.GetRank() + "]" + client.Player.Name;

that would show [Dev]Pooka

 you just need to code that GetRank method inside the Player class. all it does is return the rank of that player. Unless the rank is already a variable... let me check
