[26/09/2014 14:30:55] Mei: Well.. I'll do something too.
[26/09/2014 14:31:04] Shinkei: But what exactly happened? Im still in an interview with him...
[26/09/2014 14:31:13] KyunKyun: owo?
[26/09/2014 14:31:31] Mei: Just nvm that..
[26/09/2014 14:31:45] Shinkei: the interview?
[26/09/2014 14:32:02] Mei: Yeah, ask someone else.
[26/09/2014 14:32:09] Mei: If you want to be a mapper that is
[26/09/2014 14:32:15] Shinkei: I see..
[26/09/2014 14:32:56] Shinkei: Perhaps this should gve me a bit of time to think about this.
[26/09/2014 14:33:15] KyunKyun: i guess
[26/09/2014 14:33:24] Shinkei: I mean, yeah being a mapper is grand and all but there's responsibility that goes with it.
[26/09/2014 14:33:32] Shinkei: ANd not only that
[26/09/2014 14:33:39] KyunKyun: mhm
[26/09/2014 14:33:46] Shinkei: I feeeling a fair bit of aprehension.
[26/09/2014 14:34:27] KyunKyun: idk if i ever wanna become a rank
[26/09/2014 14:34:36] KyunKyun: maybe helper or something
[26/09/2014 14:34:45] Shinkei: Perhaps I'll ask other peeps for an interview tomorrow and let the dust settle first if you know what I mean.^ - ^;
[26/09/2014 14:34:57] Mei: Arright. Back to regular player I am.
[26/09/2014 14:35:07] Shinkei: huh?

[26/09/2014 14:35:10] Shinkei: why?
[26/09/2014 14:35:20] KyunKyun: :/
[26/09/2014 14:36:52] Shinkei: yep wrong command thing
[26/09/2014 14:37:32] Shinkei: this must be why I've been feeling aprehensive since I got here...
[26/09/2014 14:37:40] Mei: I'll go see Iggy then, see ya o; you can come if you want
[26/09/2014 14:37:55] KyunKyun: :/

[26/09/2014 14:38:16] Shinkei: I dont want to get involved but I think I may have to...

[26/09/2014 14:38:21] Shinkei: ---!

[26/09/2014 14:39:02] KyunKyun: yea :?
[26/09/2014 14:39:10] Shinkei: o - o;
[26/09/2014 14:39:18] Seven: uhm ;; im not sure ;; im trying to stay out of it;;
[26/09/2014 14:39:29] KyunKyun: oh, i see
[26/09/2014 14:39:38] Shinkei: this must be why ive felt strong aprehension since I got here.
[26/09/2014 14:39:42] Seven: conflicts give me anxiety so i prefer to avoid this kinda stuff ;;
[26/09/2014 14:39:53] KyunKyun: ok
[26/09/2014 14:40:02] Shinkei: I feel sick...
[26/09/2014 14:40:07] KyunKyun: :/
[26/09/2014 14:40:23] Seven: I guess there was a misunderstanding or somthing ;;
[26/09/2014 14:40:55] Shinkei: Being a mapper... I think I'll sit this one out for now and wait for the dust to settle.
[26/09/2014 14:41:01] Seven: Everything will be fine though ^^'
[26/09/2014 14:41:03] KyunKyun: yea
[26/09/2014 14:41:19] Shinkei: One cannot see when there's dust...
[26/09/2014 14:41:19] Seven: It might be best towait abit yeah ;;
[26/09/2014 14:41:32] Shinkei: Dust is like the conflicts here, judges ones judgement.
[26/09/2014 14:41:46] Shinkei: That's why I would like the dust to settle.
[26/09/2014 14:42:01] Seven: I agree, it's probably best to wait
[26/09/2014 14:42:05] KyunKyun: mhm
[26/09/2014 14:42:15] Shinkei: so says the wise ralts
[26/09/2014 14:42:28] Seven: The wise Shinkei
[26/09/2014 14:43:10] Seven: I didn't expect mei to resign though ;;
[26/09/2014 14:43:18] KyunKyun: mhm
[26/09/2014 14:43:22] KyunKyun: ;;
[26/09/2014 14:44:05] Shinkei: Ive been in game development before... But can I say something about PJO?
[26/09/2014 14:44:07] Seven: Hopefully things will clear up soon ;;;
[26/09/2014 14:44:11] Seven: Sure ? o:
[26/09/2014 14:44:25] Shinkei: If this keeps up PJO's days could be numbered...
[26/09/2014 14:44:46] Seven: Conflicts between staff are never good
[26/09/2014 14:44:51] Shinkei: Considering a game being in alpha stage it barely has anything to stride on once things go south
[26/09/2014 14:44:59] Seven: yeah ;;
[26/09/2014 14:45:06] Shinkei: ive seen it happen before
[26/09/2014 14:45:31] KyunKyun: hia leavern

[26/09/2014 14:45:37] Leavern: Hia
[26/09/2014 14:45:44] Seven: Alot due to staff arguments
[26/09/2014 14:45:54] KyunKyun: ;;
[26/09/2014 14:46:03] KyunKyun: i never like staff arguments
[26/09/2014 14:46:11] Seven: Its never a good thing ;;

[26/09/2014 14:47:50] Shinkei: The last dev team I was in put a lot of pressure on me, so I had to retire and leave.
[26/09/2014 14:47:54] KyunKyun: ive been in big arguments before
[26/09/2014 14:48:26] KyunKyun: ok so well, what are we gonna do?

[26/09/2014 14:52:23] KyunKyun: .-.
[26/09/2014 14:52:31] Shinkei: Code, Mechanics, layout wise should be changed.
[26/09/2014 14:53:14] Shinkei: Im not in the spot to start up a discussion like that... Perhaps not yet.^ - ^; But I'm just throwing that out there.
[26/09/2014 14:53:32] Seven: I know nothing about that sort of thing ;;'

[26/09/2014 15:02:05] KyunKyun: its oki
[26/09/2014 15:02:50] Shinkei: From the starting point the player should have an birds eye view of where's where and how to do things...
[26/09/2014 15:03:12] Shinkei: like the healing spot.
[26/09/2014 15:03:20] Shinkei: where the housing compound is.
[26/09/2014 15:03:28] KyunKyun: mhm
[26/09/2014 15:03:51] KyunKyun: thats also what i kinds dislike in Pmu
[26/09/2014 15:03:54] Shinkei: Storage, assembly, and possibly even the bank if a dynamic money proceedure is gonna made its way into the PJO code
[26/09/2014 15:03:56] KyunKyun: theres no world map
[26/09/2014 15:04:11] Seven: like a mini map kinda thing or ? ;;
