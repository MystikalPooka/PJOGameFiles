[21/09/2014 14:36:17] Chipper: Just add swearing
[21/09/2014 14:36:27] Ghost: fuck that palm tree
[21/09/2014 14:36:29] Ghost: oh
[21/09/2014 14:36:32] Ghost: :<
[21/09/2014 14:36:35] Chipper: So yea, some people are just fucked in the head, don't you agree?
[21/09/2014 14:36:40] Ghost: i agree
[21/09/2014 14:36:56] Chipper: OH SHIT
[21/09/2014 14:37:00] Mei: Woops, please don't use bad words.

[21/09/2014 14:37:10] Mei: You're gonna get muted if you do-
[21/09/2014 14:37:30] Chipper: Bravo.
[21/09/2014 14:37:46] Ghost: You can also use /warn I believe o:
[21/09/2014 14:37:50] Chipper: Yes.
[21/09/2014 14:37:57] Mei: Well I was thinking of that first tbh
[21/09/2014 14:38:08] Mei:  =3=*
[21/09/2014 14:38:08] Chipper: I kind of dislike that warn command.
[21/09/2014 14:38:12] Chipper: It's better in person
[21/09/2014 14:38:38] Ghost: Yeah I agree
[21/09/2014 14:38:41] Mei: Mhm. 
[21/09/2014 14:38:55] Chipper: Okay.
[21/09/2014 14:39:03] Chipper: So it's usually a warning first, then punishment.
[21/09/2014 14:39:11] Chipper: Let's move on to a glitch abuse.
[21/09/2014 14:39:27] Chipper:  /jail
[21/09/2014 14:39:33] Chipper: Is to send that person to jail.
[21/09/2014 14:39:39] Chipper: Usually, they don't get a warning
[21/09/2014 14:39:55] Chipper: They get jailed, then muted until the staff are ready to speak to then.
[21/09/2014 14:40:22] Chipper: I'll go do a glitch.
[21/09/2014 14:40:27] Mei: Wait
[21/09/2014 14:40:43] Mei: Will something appear if someone does a glitch abuse?
[21/09/2014 14:40:48] Ghost: mhm
