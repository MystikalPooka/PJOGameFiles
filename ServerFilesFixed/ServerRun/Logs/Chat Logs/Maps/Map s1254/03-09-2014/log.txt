[03/09/2014 20:50:40] Zerius: Hi Kas.~ C:
[03/09/2014 20:50:54] Kas: Hello.
[03/09/2014 20:51:00] Zerius: Whutcha doing? owo
[03/09/2014 20:51:08] Kas: Fixing errors.
[03/09/2014 20:51:14] Kas: Too many to count here.
[03/09/2014 20:51:15] Zerius: I see. o;;
[03/09/2014 20:51:37] Kas: And these trees work real bad with maps.
[03/09/2014 20:51:38] Zerius: You need Skype >;
[03/09/2014 20:51:42] Kas: Nah.
[03/09/2014 20:51:58] Kas: Nobody wants to meet Kas in real life.
[03/09/2014 20:52:10] Kas: Or on Skype.
[03/09/2014 20:52:19] Zerius: Ew them errors
[03/09/2014 20:52:21] Zerius: O-o
[03/09/2014 20:52:24] Kas: Yeah.
[03/09/2014 20:52:43] Zerius: You going to remap it?
[03/09/2014 20:52:57] Kas: Not fully.
[03/09/2014 20:53:05] Kas: I'll edit some details.
[03/09/2014 20:53:14] Kas: I like the way it is, but errors.
[03/09/2014 20:53:14] Zerius: I see.
[03/09/2014 20:53:30] Zerius: Yeah, if these errors get caught by players... owo
[03/09/2014 20:53:55] Kas: Yeah.
[03/09/2014 20:54:05] Kas: And they're all over the place.
[03/09/2014 20:54:13] Zerius: Who mapped it?
[03/09/2014 20:54:20] Kas: Hax.
[03/09/2014 20:54:28] Zerius: I see...
[03/09/2014 20:54:50] Zerius: You going to talk to him?
[03/09/2014 20:56:15] Kas: Maybe.
[03/09/2014 20:56:50] Zerius: I left a message in case.
[03/09/2014 20:57:11] Kas: Wow, lag is actually interfering with my mapping.
[03/09/2014 20:58:09] Kas: I dunno what to do about this cave enternce here...
[03/09/2014 20:58:32] Zerius: It's Hax's to his dungeon.
[03/09/2014 20:58:40] Zerius: But I don't think Draco likes it.
[03/09/2014 20:58:45] Zerius: Sec.
[03/09/2014 21:00:58] Zerius: So many errors.
[03/09/2014 21:00:59] Zerius: :/
[03/09/2014 21:01:03] Kas: Yeah....
[03/09/2014 21:01:18] Kas: Hmm, can you map well?
[03/09/2014 21:01:27] Zerius: Not really, but I can try.
[03/09/2014 21:01:28] Zerius: Why?
[03/09/2014 21:01:48] Kas: So far, I'm the only mapper who's mapping I fully like.
[03/09/2014 21:02:10] Zerius: I've had to revise for my GCSE's and stay after school
[03/09/2014 21:02:11] Zerius: Lol
[03/09/2014 21:02:12] Kas: (But that's just Kas being Kas)
[03/09/2014 21:02:22] Zerius: Want me to help with the overworld?
[03/09/2014 21:02:37] Kas: Maybe, I'll see how you do.
[03/09/2014 21:02:47] Zerius: I'm sorry. :L
