[26/09/2014 09:56:29] Frosty2011: Yes?
[26/09/2014 09:56:34] Iggy: To be honest.
[26/09/2014 09:56:44] Iggy: I feel like I'm getting treated like a rag doll here.
[26/09/2014 09:57:04] Iggy: Everything I did here, just gets removed one way or another.
[26/09/2014 09:57:15] Iggy: Don't know by whom, but that's how I feel.
[26/09/2014 09:57:28] Frosty2011: u ain't it's just that one u asked i got rid of pernuta
[26/09/2014 09:57:33] Frosty2011: which is scripting well
[26/09/2014 09:57:48] Frosty2011: and we need staff since it's coming to the time
[26/09/2014 09:57:53] Iggy: True.
[26/09/2014 09:57:57] Iggy: Although
[26/09/2014 09:57:59] Frosty2011: i understand
[26/09/2014 09:58:02] Frosty2011: ur right

[26/09/2014 09:58:05] Iggy: You gave me, permission.
[26/09/2014 09:58:08] Iggy: To sort the staff team.
[26/09/2014 09:58:17] Iggy: I have been sorting it out with Seven.
[26/09/2014 09:58:25] Iggy: Then, pernuta adds more.
[26/09/2014 09:59:15] Iggy: So, may I atleast have the time to sort through the staff team, make an application for staff, and an application group to decide on the person.
[26/09/2014 09:59:24] Frosty2011: yes
[26/09/2014 09:59:28] Iggy: Alright, thanks.
